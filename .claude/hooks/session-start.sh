# SessionStart hook
#
# Design principle: do work Claude can't do itself, surface things Claude can't
# otherwise see, and stay quiet about anything Claude can recompute on demand.
#
# CLOUD (CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true):
#   - Auto-rebase current branch onto origin/main (cloud sandbox is isolated,
#     safe to rewrite)
#   - Print the universal-skills reminder block
#
# Note: we deliberately do NOT cat CLAUDE.md here. Claude Code auto-loads it as
# project memory, and SessionStart only injects context via stdout/additionalContext
# (not stderr), so a stderr cat was redundant noise, not context injection.
#
# LOCAL (CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE unset):
#   - Read-only fetch from origin (prime the cache, no output)
#   - Print the universal-skills reminder block
#   - Never modify the working tree or any branch

# Retry a git fetch up to 4 times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s).
# The cloud sandbox's local git proxy occasionally returns transient 503s;
# without retries, a single blip surfaces as a SessionStart hook error.
# Usage: fetch_with_retry <args to pass to git fetch...>

# via stdout/additionalContext. stderr is user-visible diagnostic noise that
# Claude never sees. The caveman default lives in CLAUDE.md, but project memory
# is easy to miss at session start, so we re-assert it here as injected context
# to make it the first thing Claude acts on. Keep it on stdout or it does nothing.

  cat <<'CAVEMAN'
[SessionStart] ACTIVE SESSION DEFAULT: caveman ultra (per CLAUDE.md).
BEFORE your first reply, invoke the `caveman` skill at ultra intensity (Skill tool,
args: "ultra") and apply that style to ALL prose replies for the entire session:
terse, abbreviated, arrows for causality, full technical accuracy preserved. This
persists across this and every future session until the user says "stop caveman" /
"normal mode".
  - Prose only. Code, commits, PRs, file contents, and symbol/function/API/error
    strings stay normal and are never abbreviated.
  - Auto-clarity carve-outs: security warnings, irreversible-action confirmations,
    and ambiguous multi-step sequences drop to plain prose, then resume caveman.

# Print the fixed "universal skills" reminder block.
# Cross-cutting skills that apply to most sessions regardless of task; project-
# specific skills are not listed. Claude discovers those from the
# available-skills list.
print_skill_reminders() {
  cat >&2 <<'SKILLS'
[SessionStart] Universal skills. Invoke proactively when the trigger fires:
  - caveman                       → FIRST, at session start: /caveman ultra (default prose mode)
  - applying-best-practices       → BEFORE non-trivial edits (features, refactors, perf, bug fixes)
  - recall                        → BEFORE work in unfamiliar areas; /recall save <text> after gotchas
  - verification-before-completion → BEFORE claiming work is done / committing / opening a PR
  - systematic-debugging          → ON any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior
  - test-driven-development       → BEFORE writing implementation code for a feature or bugfix
  - brainstorming                 → BEFORE designing new features or behavior changes
  - safe-ship                     → BEFORE pushing / opening a PR
  - impartial-review              → AFTER substantive changes, before merging
